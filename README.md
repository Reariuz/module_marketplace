# In detail
The purpose of this application ist to build and configure an other application wich is based upon hundreds of individual sofware fragments.
Due to security concerns the name of those fragments will be called "modules" during this project.
During the production at this application there will be a nesseseraty to construct dummy modules, ignore those, they are not part of the application.

# Scope
The following funcions should be implemented:

1. Saving configuration
2. Starting all fragments of the configutation with saved parameters
3. Controling the execution during runtime
4. Integrating git
5. Marketplace to add and download new fragments
6. Role-management

# Additional info and participating
I try to use this project as a learning opportunity for me. This means I may add additional tools or libary that may seem unnessesary or over-kill, in those cases I probably just want to try interesing libaries or replicate best practices of much larger projects, just ignore them.
Also due to this being a learning project as well I will code this alone. You may review sections of code and give me feedback - for wich i will be very thankful - so I can learn from my mistakes.

If you want to create a feedback topic (i still have to figure out what is the best way for doing so) please read the [Code of Conduct](.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) beforehand.
